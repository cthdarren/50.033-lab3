  - "Stranger\u2026 please, hear me. I am missing pieces of my soul. Without them,
    I will fade into nothing. Help me find the three that remain."
  - Do not worry, you need not return to me. The souls will fly back towards me when
    met with an external disturbance.
  - Imagine if you'd have to walk all the way back to me. What poor game design that
    would be. Assuming this was a game of course. Sorry I just like playing games.
